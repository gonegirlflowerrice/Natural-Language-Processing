Unfortunate, because that's what made this place unique.\\n\\n---------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOne of my favourite vegetarian restaurants in the city and I visit whenever I get a chance!\\n\\nThey have many options here, not just sushi/Japanese, although that's where the place really shines in my opinion. I don't come here for the cooked stir-fry stuff, there are plenty a dozen of other Chinese vegetarian places whipping up that stuff in the city. Bento boxes can be had for $11-13 with a variety of combinations, accompanied by a miso soup. But what I really love, especially with good company, is the all-you-can-eat option. There's no other Japanese vegetarian place in the GTA that I know of that does this!\\n\\nIt's great to get a break from just being able to order generic avocado rolls, cucumber rolls, yam tempura, etc. like you would at regular AYCE Japanese restaurants. The rolls are much more varied here. They are well made by any standard -- the filling to rice ratio is excellent, the food is well presented, ingredients are fresh, and it is delicious. My only gripe is that it can be quite slow at times (depending on which guy is working behind the counter making the sushi). \\n\\nThe dinner AYCE option adds a few more specialized rolls and items, like the green dragon and caterpillar rolls. Worth the price difference? Not really in my opinion. Regular Japanese places charge more for dinner only because you can order special items like sashimi at dinner time. Here, there is no sufficient justification for the higher charge. When they first introduced the AYCE option, the dinner and lunch menus were completely identical! Now they've improved the dinner items a bit -- it's good to see that these guys are constantly improving! Note that dinner does not include any mock sashimi. Personally, I don't care much for it because I'm not really a fan of it -- it's impressive how much it resembles actual sashimi, but I don't particularly enjoy it.\\n\\nService has always been courteous and friendly (and the servers speak decent English as far as Asian restaurants are concerned).\", 'date': '2013-10-04 03:20:59'}, {'review_id': '9bTiPZcz2xDxuF28ZiLWJg', 'user_id': 'AvbxsP_DPAkVf3sfiN7FGw', 'business_id': 'XuZ9pksVQBIpmVQm6UO2YQ', 'stars': 4.0, 'useful': 0, 'funny': 0, 'cool': 0, 'text': 'Service was good and the \"duck\" noodles I  soup was pretty good...definitely come back to try their buffet sushi menu', 'date': '2016-06-12 03:16:56'}, {'review_id': 'wjzUffX7rjnCIWML6gM0kw', 'user_id': '0J9mtVJ4_QGsXYVK8qJzOQ', 'business_id': 'XuZ9pksVQBIpmVQm6UO2YQ', 'stars': 5.0, 'useful': 4, 'funny': 2, 'cool': 3, 'text': 'This restaurant is very vegan friendly.

I think this is the wrong one...\" No problem she takes it back to the counter. Then the platter comes out. Looks pretty enough, but there was something just weird about it .. square slices of fish, funny looking white thing lots of arms... then our eel/avo plate comes back and it now has avo but still has fried tuna skin slices.

The price of the ayce is comparable to sushi places with real meat/fish, and I feel kind of ripped off paying that same price for fake meat/fish which cost less.\\n\\n Speaking of sashimi I was quite impressed by how close to the real thing this place got. The texture is like a firm jelly and they lay the sashimi on top of seaweed so some of the fishy taste latches on to the \"sashimi\". Their specialty rolls are also very good.

The outside is wrapped in the most delicately sliced king mushroom. The avocado and cream cheese filling in the middle makes it a dreamy one-bite.\\n- House Special Duck: The house duck really looked the part! The 'skin' on the duck was very crispy and the inside was definitely meat-like. It really amazing smoky BBQ like flavor. Also the bed of spinach it was served on was also flavored really well, which was a huge plus.\\n- Sweet Sour Eel: I'm not usually a huge fan of eel because of all the teeny tiny bones that you have to watch out for. That's obviously not a problem here! The eel pieces looked the part, had great flavor on their own, and when dipped in the sauce was fantastic. \\n- Gyoza: The gyoza were also pretty good. A tasty filling. \\n- Pineapple Chicken Fried Rice: The perfect starchy compliment to the meal.

Unfortunate, because that's what made this place unique.\\n\\n---------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOne of my favourite vegetarian restaurants in the city and I visit whenever I get a chance!\\n\\nThey have many options here, not just sushi/Japanese, although that's where the place really shines in my opinion. I don't come here for the cooked stir-fry stuff, there are plenty a dozen of other Chinese vegetarian places whipping up that stuff in the city. Bento boxes can be had for $11-13 with a variety of combinations, accompanied by a miso soup. But what I really love, especially with good company, is the all-you-can-eat option. There's no other Japanese vegetarian place in the GTA that I know of that does this!\\n\\nIt's great to get a break from just being able to order generic avocado rolls, cucumber rolls, yam tempura, etc. like you would at regular AYCE Japanese restaurants. The rolls are much more varied here. They are well made by any standard -- the filling to rice ratio is excellent, the food is well presented, ingredients are fresh, and it is delicious. My only gripe is that it can be quite slow at times (depending on which guy is working behind the counter making the sushi). \\n\\nThe dinner AYCE option adds a few more specialized rolls and items, like the green dragon and caterpillar rolls. Worth the price difference? Not really in my opinion. Regular Japanese places charge more for dinner only because you can order special items like sashimi at dinner time. Here, there is no sufficient justification for the higher charge. When they first introduced the AYCE option, the dinner and lunch menus were completely identical! Now they've improved the dinner items a bit -- it's good to see that these guys are constantly improving! Note that dinner does not include any mock sashimi. Personally, I don't care much for it because I'm not really a fan of it -- it's impressive how much it resembles actual sashimi, but I don't particularly enjoy it.\\n\\nService has always been courteous and friendly (and the servers speak decent English as far as Asian restaurants are concerned).\"]\n",

Looks pretty enough, but there was something just weird about it .. square slices of fish, funny looking white thing lots of arms... then our eel/avo plate comes back and it now has avo but still has fried tuna skin slices. The waitress probably noticed all of our perplexed looks because she then states \"This is a vegetarian restaurant. This IS our eel roll.\"  Boy were we fooled!\\n\\nIt\\'s hard to judge the food because I\\'ve never wished to try vegetarian sushi given the choice of real fish versus some hard jelly that\\'s made to look and feel like salmon.

They use some magic and manage to create plant-based raw fish, isn't that insane?!! Albeit an interesting experience, it was just too weird for me.

The texture is like a firm jelly and they lay the sashimi on top of seaweed so some of the fishy taste latches on to the \"sashimi\". Their specialty rolls are also very good. In particular I recommend the super yam roll and the one with mango. Each roll is very sizable and are loaded with ingredients. \\n\\nThey also offer some chinese/thai dishes. I recommend anything that is fried and slathered with their sweet and sour. This ranges from fake chicken to bean curd slithers and all are delicious. Batter is super crispy and sweet and sour sauce reaches the perfect balance between the two tastes.\\n\\nOverall great place to go with a vegetarian friend who\\'s tired of the typical vegetarian fare!']\n",

I would serve this platter to all my meat eater friends just to impress them and freak them out! I can't wait to go back and try other platters and their lunch specials! Fast service and friendly service. 5 stars from a humble veggie!!!\"]\n",

Almost everything tasted like real fish. I really enjoyed the mock salmom sashimi.  It had a very similar texture and an even better taste than real fish, but less slimy.  It was amazing.  \\n\\nThe mock shrimp was pretty good too.\\n\\nVerdict: I\\'ll be back for more soon.\\n\\nOnly con: I thought service was a bit lacking as I had to ask for my miso soup and the server seemed unhappy that I was asking.

I don't understand why this place is never packed, if this was situated downtown, it'd definitely do very well. (Name me at least 5 vegans in markham that you know. Exactly) \\n\\nI came here twice so far and I la-la-love it. What blows my mind is the 'salmon sashimi' and fake salmon.... omfg, it's ridiculous how close it tastes to the real thing, texture wise. It's everything salmon was to me except it doesn't have a fishy smell AND it's cruelty free - 100% approve! That smell that smells smelly. Even my omnivore friend was mind blown by how good it was.\\n\\nAlso, the fake chicken tripped me the helllll out. The texture was on point and I lowkey got scared. The sauce was tasty as well and gave me a flashback of my love for teriyaki chicken back then. Such a good replacement and tasted exactly the same.\\n\\nHonestly it's kind of expensive, considering real fish isn't used but it's a great vegan friendly treat and it's nice to know we have one here in Markham aka meat-lovers land!\"]\n",

The mock fish made me nervous but the textures were beautiful and the flavour mild yet complementary to the veggies. How can I just go back to eating sub par cucumber rolls now?? \\nThis place is just so far away from me and all other veg sushi is ruined forever. How is this gem in Markham and not in Toronto??

            " [\"I didn't think that vegan sushi would stand a chance against the 'real' stuff but it turns out that fish ARE friends and not food! Tenon is a Japanese restaurant (with some Chinese-ish fare) so you'll see things on the menu like bento boxes and maki rolls along side some roast duck and chicken dishes. We ordered:\\n- Gold Dragon Roll: They promised mango and they delivered on mango! \\nThe entire roll is covered with slivers of mango and mango sauce. You'd think it'd be too sweet but they balanced it really well with salt in the form of the BBQ sauce. Also what the heck?! How could vegetarian tempura shrimp taste so good?\\n- Tenon Roll: This roll was a lot of interesting textures and delicious flavors altogether. The outside is wrapped in the most delicately sliced king mushroom. The avocado and cream cheese filling in the middle makes it a dreamy one-bite.\\n- House Special Duck: The house duck really looked the part! The 'skin' on the duck was very crispy and the inside was definitely meat-like. It really amazing smoky BBQ like flavor. Also the bed of spinach it was served on was also flavored really well, which was a huge plus.\\n- Sweet Sour Eel: I'm not usually a huge fan of eel because of all the teeny tiny bones that you have to watch out for. That's obviously not a problem here! The eel pieces looked the part, had great flavor on their own, and when dipped in the sauce was fantastic. \\n- Gyoza: The gyoza were also pretty good. A tasty filling. \\n- Pineapple Chicken Fried Rice: The perfect starchy compliment to the meal. Lots of great filling and you never noticed that the chicken wasn't chicken. \\nI was pretty much in awe of this meal. I was just so surprised that everything tasted so good even though it was meatless...maybe those vegans aren't so crazy after all?! I will comment that it was a teensy bit expensive considering that everything was meatless but well worth if if you're looking for the best vegetarian/vegan sushi in the GTA!\"]\n",

Our sushi feast included 4 special rolls, 4 regular rolls, 2 hand rolls, and 1 appetizer.  \\n\\nAll the rolls had the rice on the outside and one of our special rolls, the Montreal Roll, was tempura roll where the entire roll is battered and fried. After scanning the menu for tempura rolls, In thought there were none so that was a pleasant surprise. \\n\\nTenon is very generous with the avocado which I very much appreciated. My favorite roll was topped with avocado, a zillion thing slices crowded together. The king mushroom special roll was another favorite. It\\'s five pieces and topped with 5 large bonus pieces of tempura mushroom in addition to the tempura mushroom inside the roll.\\n\\nAs soon as we sat down, they brought us a hot pot of complementary green tea. The tea was permeated with the flavor of toasted rice and was quite lovely.\\n\\nA note to vegans - the items on the menu with cream cheese are not labeled with the red dot meaning \"contains eggs or dairy\" but I do believe they are made with dairy cream cheese. I first this I ordered was Philadelphia roll and the last thing I said was that we wanted the food vegan. The Philadelphia roll came without cream cheese so I can only assume the cream cheese is not vegan.  For some reason the red dot only appears next to items with mayonnaise.\\n\\nThere are lots of types of vegan seafood - salmon, crab, shrimp, as well as meat - chicken, duck, beef, etc. \\n\\nHighly recommended.

This has never happened to me before.  When asking for something,she rudely asked what? But to the biracial couple,she was like yes? With a pleasant smile. In the beginning,we asked to sit in their nice unreserved private area. SHE IGNORED OUR QUESTION AND TOLD US TO SIT IN THE NORMAL TABLES. Later on,there were two white women who asked to sit in that same area and the WAITRESS SAID YES WITH A FAKE SMILE. I was feeling that she was trying way harder to treat the white people better.

The fish fillet was bland and liver was meh. Salmon and chicken was really flavourable. Such a fun place to eat at for a date or group of friends. Even alone. No judgments here. \\nThe staff is attentive, nice and considerate.
